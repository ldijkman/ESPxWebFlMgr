<b>SIEMENS</b> related, People first read the license at the bottom ?!

# Raised &euro; 200 Euro for the first that gives a working code 

## for this Filemanager to run on ESPAsyncWebServer.h? (ESP8266)

like it is now, 

Now running / working on ESP8266WebServer.h

Code submissions => https://github.com/ldijkman/ESPxWebFlMgr/discussions (link to sourcecode?)

for proffessional coders it maybe not enough, but it may trigger other ;-)

Electra Begs, Can SomeOne Please?

 Make this work with ESPAsyncWebServer?

## ESPxWebFlMgr by Holger Lembke

### HowTo run this WebFilemanager on a ESP8266 LittleFS

download zip => https://github.com/ldijkman/ESPxWebFlMgr/archive/refs/heads/master.zip

arduino ide=>sketch=>include library=>add zip library   (ESPxWebFlMgr-master.zip)

arduino ide=>file=>examples=>ESP8266 Web File Manager => ESP8266basic   example

line 44 fill ssid and pasword for your wifirouter connection

upload data directory to ESP8266 LittleFS (Descripton HowToDoTHAT in ESP8266basic   example)

program the ESP8266 and Browse to the IP that is given in serial monitor

https://www.google.com/search?q=ESP8266 minimal 32mbit==4MByte version? Better with USB connection

# Edit Electra's Skin online inbrowser WebFileManager

Would like to run this on ESPAsyncWebServer 

So that we can change the Look and Feel of Electra with skins (HTML / CSS)

Modify Electra like you like her to be

- Without any ESP/Arduino programming for a bigger audience
- Edit a HTML/CSS design in jsfiddle.net or codepen.io or other online/offline designer
- wifimanager.html https://jsfiddle.net/luberth/4avpquhs/show
- index.html https://jsfiddle.net/luberth/sx61b08t/show
- schedule.html https://jsfiddle.net/luberth/ow3zceyn/show
- 
- - and upload or edit copy/paste it with the  WebFileManager Editor on the ESPx LittleFS

- Got to Please Electra https://github.com/ldijkman/randomnerd_esp32_wifi_manager

Some Changes, WishList ?:
- run on ESPAsyncWebServer, Make Electra Happy?
- <del>extra colomn/row for preview files in browser</del> == i have added a V button
- <del>maybe small icons instead of letters</del> == done with a font, later images maybe less and no external traffic
- <del>there is no E edit for .txt files </del>=> i see in code i can set #define fileManagerEditEverything
- a touch or click on dropzone should open a filebrowsebox for uploading (try to drag/drop files on phone, i cannot, dontknow)
- maybe a new file create button
- unzip button
- textarea colored simple syntax higlighting == CodeMirror
- a checbox to show hidden --sysfiles
- a button to upgrade the system firmware.BIN
- Fiddling with Electra
- share files between electra clones http://kitchen.local garage.local living.local etc. for skins and firmware.bin
- Try-it Editor/previewer that can open/save and add an icon on filelist <img src="https://github.com/ldijkman/ESPxWebFlMgr/blob/master/examples/ESP8266basic/data/--try-it.png?raw=true"> icon suggstion

can you help shorten above wishlist?

Trying icon font =  no rename maybe  A&curarr;B  ,  hee a &#8623; Electra &#8623; character

maybe less size/no external traffic when i make images from the font == now images, --files.png = not shown in filemanager list

added a drop file zone icon middle left

# WOW, Can Electra have her own JSFiddle Clone

# YES! Running on ESP8266 

fork https://github.com/ldijkman/jsbin-jsfiddle-clone  original https://github.com/swapnilmishra/jsbin-jsfiddle-clone

## Edit Electra's Skin locally (View as you Type, realtime WYSIWYG)

even better as jsfiddle or codepen

all small script files, the biggest codemirror.js i allready have for the editor

looks like 160kb extra file uncompressed

# Fiddle With Electra served from ESP8266
## Warning Fiddling with Electra can Kill you!

just an upload  files to esp8266 filemanager https://github.com/ldijkman/ESPxWebFlMgr/tree/master/jsbin-jsfiddle-clone nothing coded yet

## Upgrade Electra from filemanager
## ESP8266 system Update/upgrade from firmware.bin 

upload over the filemanager to update no programming usb cable needed

if firmware.bin is in the filemanager list uploaded
- note: changed /ESP8266basic.ino.bin so no rename is needed just drag and drop on filemanager file upload

press update button to perform update

you can create a bin file in Arduino IDE when pressing the check code V verify button left of ->upload program button

check the compiler output text where the bin file is stored => upload it and rename it to firmware.bin

in compiler text => Creating BIN file "/tmp/arduino_build_606192/ESP8266basic.ino.bin"

(pi 400 drops USB (20 year old USB logitech webcam wich i could use as microphone. think on poweruse)

Alexander W. on Facebook commented => looks like LCARS

Wikipedia => In the Star Trek fictional universe, LCARS is a computer operating system. Within Star Trek chronology

an LCARS index /  css skin would be nice for Electra = Start Trek Electra house controlled devices
