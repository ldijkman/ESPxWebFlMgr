code / extracted files come from

https://github.com/swapnilmishra/jsbin-jsfiddle-clone

made it minmin files --files ar not listed in ESP8266 filemanager == hidden

 String _SysFileStartPattern =  "\\--"; // files that start with -- are hidden, Holger had  "\\." do not like, harder to delete in LINUX su sudo

CodeMirror Electra allready has compressed for the editor
